# VPA_GLOSSARY.md
**Project:** VPA — Canonical System  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for terms and meanings (Anna Couling framing).  
**Rule:** If a term is not here, an AI agent should not use it as if it’s canonical.

---

## A

### Accumulation
A campaign phase where **insiders buy** (build inventory) before marking price up. Public typically sells into this phase.

### Anomaly
A condition where **effort vs result** does not “make sense”:
- effort = volume  
- result = price outcome (spread/progress)  
An anomaly is a warning of potential change and must be interpreted with trend location + structure.

---

## B

### Benchmark chart / Dominant timeframe
The slower timeframe used to determine the **dominant trend** and provide risk bias.

### Buying climax (Couling usage)
A climactic action associated with **insider buying** that appears at/near the **bottom** after a bearish move (transition toward bullish campaign).

---

## C

### Candle (anatomy)
Price bar components: open/high/low/close; **spread** (body), **upper wick**, **lower wick**.

### Congestion / Range
A bounded region where price oscillates and “cause” can build over time.

### Cause and Effect
Time + participation (cause) can precede a larger move (effect). Longer preparation can lead to larger eventual moves.

---

## D

### Distribution
A campaign phase where **insiders sell** inventory into public demand, often after a bullish run and near highs.

---

## E

### Effort vs Result
Core VPA lens:
- **Effort:** volume  
- **Result:** price movement/spread/progress  
Mismatch → anomaly.

---

## H

### Hammer
A candle shape associated with **strength** (often after decline): price falls then recovers, leaving a prominent **lower wick**. Requires volume + context + confirmation.

---

## I

### Insiders
Couling’s umbrella term for professional operators (market makers/specialists/large money) who run campaigns: buy wholesale, sell retail.

---

## N

### No demand (Couling framing)
A condition where price is marked higher but demand is absent/weak—often evidenced by **failure to hold the move** and confirmed by **low volume** (commonly discussed with shooting star / test-of-demand behavior).

---

## P

### Price action
What price does on the chart, read via candle anatomy and sequences, never in isolation from volume.

---

## R

### Ripples (multi-timeframe)
Change is detected first on faster timeframes (“ripples”), then appears on primary and dominant charts.

---

## S

### Selling climax (Couling usage)
Climactic action associated with **insider selling** that appears at/near the **top** after a bullish move (transition toward markdown).

### Shooting star
A candle shape associated with **weakness**: price marks up then fails, closing back near the open and leaving a prominent **upper wick**. Volume and context determine significance; can function as a test of demand.

### Spread
The candle body magnitude (open↔close). Used as a proxy for “result” in effort vs result.

### Stopping volume
Volume that halts a decline (professional buying absorbing selling). Treated as a potential transition signal requiring confirmation.

### Support / Resistance
Structural price levels/areas where price reacts. In this project, structure is derived from swings/congestion and optionally supported by VAP density.

---

## T

### Test (general)
A deliberate probe to confirm whether supply or demand is present/absent.

### Test of supply
A probe (often after accumulation/congestion) to confirm selling pressure has been removed. Typically confirmed by **low volume**.

### Test of demand
A probe (often after distribution/topping) to confirm demand is absent. Typically confirmed by **low volume** and failure to hold markup.

### Topping out volume
Exhaustion behavior near highs (insiders selling into demand), often preceding distribution/selling climax signatures.

### Trend location
Where price is relative to the trend structure: **top / bottom / middle**. Mandatory context for interpreting anomalies.

---

## V

### Validation
When volume “makes sense” with price action (effort supports result), implying continuation bias until anomalies appear.

### Volume
The unhideable footprint of participation; treated as “effort” and the validator/lie detector of price action.

### VAP (Volume At Price)
Volume distribution by price level (density). Used as supportive structure (barriers/levels), not a replacement for VPA.

### VPA (Volume Price Analysis)
Couling’s method: price action interpreted and confirmed (or contradicted) by volume, within context, to infer likely next move.

### Wick
Upper/lower shadows representing intrabar sentiment shifts and rejection; significance depends on volume and location.
